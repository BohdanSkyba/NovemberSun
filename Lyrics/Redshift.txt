Enter Shikari - Redshift

We drift apart, We drift apart
We drift apart, We drift apart

[Verse 1]
If there's one reason to smile
It's when you look up out at night
You're fortunate enough
To drink in a vista
A 100 billion flares
Display a glowing history
Splayed out across a canvas, the night sky
But, for a moment just contemplate
When looking up, you only saw a blank slate
And, for a moment just contemplate
It appears that heavens been abandoned

[Chorus]
We accelerate
Through the estate of outer space
We accelerate
We separate, we fragment
We accelerate
Through the estate of outer space
We accelerate
It appears that heavens been abandoned

[Verse 2]
I climbed down from the wall
Where I sit and search for a source sublime
Other than our dear sun, the lone star, oh
But, for a moment just contemplate
When looking up, you only saw a blank slate
And, for a moment just contemplate
It appears that heavens been abandoned

Just contemplate
What if the heavens were abandoned?

[Chorus]
We accelerate
Through the estate of outer space
We accelerate
We separate, we fragment
We accelerate
Through the extent of outer space
We accelerate
It appears that heavens been abandoned

Your skin and bones
Heart and mind
Are made from the remnants of... stars
That died
And can you feel it inside?
Can you feel it inside?
Can you feel it inside?

A supergiant erupts, into a supernova
The ultimate sacrifice
And we are the descendants!
A supergiant erupts, into a supernova
The ultimate sacrifice
And we are the descendants!

We drift apart, We drift apart
We drift apart, We drift apart
